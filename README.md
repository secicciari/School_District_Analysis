# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview
### Purpose
I have been asked by th school board to identify evidence of academic dishonesty in the math and reading scores for ninth graders at Thomas High School. 
To do this analysis I've been asked to replace Thomas High School ninth-grade math and reading schores with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact, and then to repeat the school district analysis that I previously completed with the original data. I will compare the two school district analyses to determine how they are affected by the changes to the grades.


## Results
### Affect on District Summary

### Affect on School Summary

## Summary
Four major changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at THS were replaced with NaNs.
